      <h1 class="why-h1">Why We Built <em>Voices of Residents</em></h1>
      <p class="why-lede">
        Voices of Residents highlights local voices on issues they observe in their communities. It’s a platform where people can submit concerns, discuss with neighbors, and explore solutions — helping relieve some worries. Local leaders can also use it to better understand residents’ needs and challenges.

          <ul class="why-ul">
            <li>Concerns get scattered across private chats and social media, so they’re hard to track or act on.</li>
            <li>Residents don’t always know where to take an issue—or whether neighbors see the same thing.</li>
            <li>Leaders want signal, not noise: clear summaries, locations, and context from the people affected.</li>

            Voices of Residents is not an emergency service or a replacement for official reporting systems.
            For emergencies, call <span class="why-kbd">911</span>. For city services, use your local <span class="why-kbd">311</span> or the appropriate department portal.
